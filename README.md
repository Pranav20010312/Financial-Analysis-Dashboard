# **Financial Analysis Dashboard**

This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive financial analysis using Power BI to explore and visualize data, extract insights, and support decision-making. The following steps were performed:

• Data Preparation: Financial data was collected and then imported into Power BI for further analysis.

•	Data Transformation: Data Transformation was performed using Power Query . The raw financial data was imported into Power BI and underwent necessary 
   transformations such as cleaning, filtering, and shaping. This ensured that the data was in a suitable format for analysis.

• Data Modeling: Data modeling techniques were implemented to establish key relationships between different tables and create a cohesive data model. This involved 
   identifying relevant entities, defining primary and foreign keys, and establishing relationships to enable effective analysis.

• Interactive Power BI Dashboard: An interactive and visually appealing Power BI dashboard was developed to present the analyzed financial data. The dashboard 
  utilized a variety of charts, graphs, and tables to provide a comprehensive view of the financial performance.


## **Key Insights:**
• Based on the analysis, the following key insights were derived:

•	Profit has been consistently increasing over time.

•	Product sales peak in October and November.

•	The Passo product yields the highest profit. 

•	Products in Mexico generate lower profits.

## **Solution:**
•	By providing attractive discounts, the demand for products in this market is likely to rise, leading to higher profits.

•	Identifying popular products in the Mexican market and promoting them can lead to increased sales and profitability. Understanding customer preferences and 
  aligning product offerings accordingly can drive success in this market.
